            <p>Pratham is one of the most easy-going person you will ever come across. Do not be intimidated by his bulky frame, on the inside he is the 'big bowl of mush' so to say. Having attended numerous conferences across the city over the past years, he has made his name in the Kolkata circuit as a delegate who one better not come across in a committee discussing Syria. Having started his experience as a top delegate by becoming the white eye best delegate, foreign policy is of utmost importance to him. He is also known to be very tactful and has great business acumen. Getting a job done by delegating it to someone is one of his most useful talents.</p>

            <p>Pranav Choudhury is one of the well-established MUNners and debaters in Kolkata. He is the most prolific speaker you are going to find whether it be in English, Hindi or Japanese. He may seem to be a little cocky but he is as helpful and approachable as someone gets. Having been the deputy head boy of his school and having represented both his school and nation at an international level, he is the perfect person take up any discussion or argument with at any time, any place, for he just LOVES to debate, to argue, although sometimes unnecessarily. A message from him: どうぞよろしくおねがいします</p>

This executive board member is known to be jovial, humorous and friendly, but be warned, do not underestimate his capabilities. With rich experience in all types of committees, he has garnered placements from various MUN conferences including CJCMUN, TISBMUN, SJPUCMUN, NCFEMUN, to name a few. When he isn’t occupied with Model UN conferences or his education, he can more often than not be found on the badminton court. His friends describe him as approachable and fun, but he's a different person once he's in committee. Look before you leap, they say. Mess with him and you'll find out why.
